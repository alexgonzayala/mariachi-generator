# mariachi-generator
AI/ML personal project - dataset and model creation from scratch. looking to generate mariachi music well. want to try supervised learning, am open to see if there is an unsupervised learning and/or reinforcement learning technique to solve this problem.
Will be adding a better README later with a detailed overview and methodology of this project.

For now, the direction of the project is as follows:

1. Preparing the dataset 
  - how am I going to make the dataset? Do PDFs of mariachi music scores suffice? 
  - If so, must credit sources of music files.

2. Data preprocessing
  - how am I going to turn the music scores into data that can be interpreted by my model? 
  - how can I leverage Optimal music recognition tech to do this?
  - then, how will I make sure mariachi music in specific is represented adequately such that my model will be able to learn that these pieces of music are different from for example,       Bach piano rolls?

3. Creation of model(s)
  - What models will I use?
  - get a refresher on transformers, self-attention, attention, as it seems that this is what previous music generation models have done.

4. Testing model(s)

5. Generating mariachi music!
